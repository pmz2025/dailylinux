# Learning from experts

Here I'm collecting what i found useful, meaningful
which i can use in my day to day job.

```shell
# Check all changes in a file using blame

git blame <nameOfTheFile>

The expected output is, all changes and who made those changes

# Check which files are ignored by git

git status --ignored

# 

```
